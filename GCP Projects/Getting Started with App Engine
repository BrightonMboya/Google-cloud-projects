Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

Initialize App Engine.

Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible

Task 1.
  1.1 Login to your google console
  1.2 activate cloud shell

Task 2.
  2.1 Initialize App engine
      gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
           when prompted click done

  2.2 Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
       git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

  2.3 Navigate to the source directory:
      cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

Task 3.
    Run the Hello world Locally

    3.1 Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.
            sudo apt-get update

    3.2 Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application.
     Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.
          sudo apt-get install virtualenv
               if prompted[Y/N] press y then press enter
          virtualenv -p python3 venv

     3.3 Activate the virtual environment
           source venv/bin/activate

     3.4 Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.
          pip install  -r requirements.txt

     3.5 Run the application
           python main.py
              ignore the warning if any

      3.6 In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.
          To preview the web application you may need collapse the navigation menu
          To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service.

Task 4.
       Deploy and run the Hello World App on App Engine.

       4.1 Navigate to the source directory:
           cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

       4.2 Deploy your hello world App
            gcloud app deploy
                If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.
                This app deploy command uses the app.yaml file to identify project configuration.

       4.3 Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
            gcloud app browse

       4.4 Copy and Paste the URL in a new browser window

Task 5:
      Disable the Application
      5.1 In the cloud Console, In the navigation menu click App Engine > Settings
      5.2 Click Disable application
      5.3 Read the dialog message. Enter the App ID and click DISABLE.
         If you refresh the browser window you used to view to the application site, you'll get a 404 error.

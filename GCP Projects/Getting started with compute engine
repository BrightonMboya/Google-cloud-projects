#In this lab we will walk through the lab 'getting started with compute engine'
#we will create a sample vm and perform the tasks as assign below
#Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

Connect between the two instances.
Task 1:
   1.Sign in to the google cloud console
   2.activate the cloud console

Task 2:
    1.in the cloud console enter the following command to create an instance
        'gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-1" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --zone=us-central1-a --tags=http'
Task3:
configuring the http tag
   1.the following command will create the firewall rule to config the http tag
   'gcloud compute firewall-rules create "my-vm-1" --allow=tcp:80'

Task4: create another vm
   1.First set the default zone to the one different from that of the VM with this command
     'gcloud config set compute/zone uscentral1-b'
   2.run this command to list zones available on the uscentral1 region
    gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" \
    --machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
    --image-project "debian-cloud" \
    --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
     --subnet "default"

Task5: connect btn two instances
  1.to connect btn two instances first initialize ssh by the following command
  gcloud compute ssh my-vm-1 --zone=us-central1-a
     -you will then be prompted to enter a paraphrase for the ssh
       -enter the any paraphrase press enter and re-enter the paraphrase again

   2.then use the following command to ping the vm-1
      ping my-vm-1
         - you can use ctrl + c to abort the command

  3.Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1
     ssh my-vm-1
        If you are prompted about whether you want to continue connecting to a host with unknown authenticity,
        enter yes to confirm that you do

   3.At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server
     sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

   4.Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server
     sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

   5. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this,
      and replace YOUR_NAME with your name
       Hi from YOUR_NAME

   6.Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.

  7.Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
      curl http://localhost/

  8. To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
      curl http://my-vm-1/
